# Godot 4 OpenXR demo project

What you are looking at is my absolutely crappy demo project for testing the OpenXR logic we're porting into Godot 4 core. Maybe one day it will evolve into a proper demo project (thats the hope). Contributions super welcome.

Use in combination with https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/56394
